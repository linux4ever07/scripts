# This script creates a duplicate of the directory specified, by
# recursively re-creating the sub-directories and then creating symbolic
# links for all the files.

# The script takes two arguments, first being input directory, and
# second being the name of the output directory.

# This script was originally created to allow me to seed two slightly
# different versions of the same torrent at once. I removed some files
# and added some files in the new version of the torrent, and the rest
# of the files are symlinks.

# The permissions of the output directory will be root for owner, and
# group, with only read permissions for everyone else. Permissions only
# affect the created sub-directories in the output directory, not the
# symlinks.
